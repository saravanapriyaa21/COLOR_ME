# COLOR√â - color your space, your way
Ever wondered how your room would look in a new color?
COLOR√â lets you try out wall colors on your own room photos‚Äîinstantly. Just upload a pic, pick a shade, and watch the walls change without touching the furniture. It‚Äôs like a smart paint test, but way cooler.

Powered by AI, MongoDB, and a bit of magic,
Built with love using React, Flask, and Google Cloud.

## How It Works

1. *Image Upload*: Users upload a room photo from their device.
2. *Label Detection*: Google Vision API identifies key elements (e.g., "Living Room", "Couch", etc.).
3. *Embedding Generation*: The best matching label is converted into a numerical vector embedding.
4. *Vector Search*: MongoDB Atlas searches for colors with similar aesthetic embeddings.
5. *Color Suggestions*: Top 3 color shades are suggested.
6. *Tinted Preview*: The selected color is realistically applied to the wall area of the uploaded image using masking and color blending.
